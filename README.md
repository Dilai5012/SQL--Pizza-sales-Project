Hello everyone,
I am excited to share my first SQL project titled "Pizza Sales Analysis". 

üîç OBJECTIVE: This project is to analyze pizza sales data to derive actionable insights. Specifically, it aims to:-

‚ú¥ Determine the total number of orders and overall revenue.
‚ú¥ Identify the highest-priced pizza and the most commonly ordered size.
‚ú¥ List the top 5 pizza types based on order frequency.
‚ú¥ Examine the distribution of orders by hour and calculate average daily orders.
‚ú¥ Assess the contribution of each pizza type to total revenue and analyze cumulative revenue trends.

üöÄ Insights:
‚û° Revenue Leaders: The Classic and Supreme pizzas are major contributors to our revenue, indicating a strong customer preference for these items.
‚û° Size Preference: The Large pizza is the most popular, guiding our inventory strategy.
‚û° Popular Categories: Classic and Chicken pizzas are top sellers. We should focus promotions on these types.
‚û° Lunchtime Peak: Orders surge around noon and early afternoon. Increasing staff during these hours will improve service.
‚û° Average Daily Sales: We sell about 138 pizzas daily, aiding in inventory and staffing planning.
‚û° Top Performers: Chicken-based pizzas, particularly the Thai Chicken and Barbecue Chicken, lead in sales, while Classic options like the Classic Deluxe and Hawaiian are also popular.

Understanding demand for specific pizzas allows us to optimize inventory and ensure we have enough stock of our top sellers.
üöÄ These insights will help improve sales strategies and enhance understanding of customer preferences in the pizza industry. üìà
